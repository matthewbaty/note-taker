# Note-Taker

## Description

This is a note taking full stack application that allows user to create notes and then save them. The notes are saved using JSON and then retrieved using JSON when a user comes back to the page or clicks on one of the old notes on the left side. I did not include the delete functionality in my code.

## Installation

## Usage

This application will allow the user to take notes throughout the day. The user can give each note a title and then fill in the notes field. They are able to save their notes and have them stored on an express server so if they leave the page and come back the saved notes will still be there. The delete functionality is not yet coded into this application.
